                    The availability of Google Drive sync is not guaranteed
                    indefinitely, as it depends on Google&apos;s APIs and
                    policies. You are responsible for maintaining backups of
                    your data. Periodic use of the export feature is
                    recommended.

                    You can stop using aijot and delete your data at any time.
                    Use the Clear all data or Reset app options in Settings. If
                    you have Google Drive backups, you can delete those directly
                    from your Google Drive.
